Predicting ATP Match Winners using Demographics

This paper is about predicting the winner of ATP tennis matches based on age, height, country, and their recent form. 
Within my EDA I developed bar plots, scatter plots, and a line plot to show the relationship between these variables and their impact on winning tennis matches. 
I then built three models, which are a logistic regression, random forest model, and decision tree model that take into account the variables above and use them to predict the winner of tennis matches. By calculating the difference between the variables for the two plyers competiting against each other and using that data to predict other matchups, the three models use the dataset to predict winners. 
The paper then goes over these findings and places them within the context of the ATP circuit.
